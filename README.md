This is the code of the completed Hyperskill project "Error Correcting Encoder-Decoder".
You can learn more about the project on the Hyperskill here: https://hyperskill.org/projects/58?track=1

This code uses bitwise/bitshift operations to encode the file contents using Hamming(7, 4) code,
emulate transmitting it over the lossy channel (causing one error a byte) and then decoding the received file with error correction.
